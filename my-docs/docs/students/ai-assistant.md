## Example Conversations

### Getting Help with Math

```
You: "I don't understand how to solve this equation"

AI: "Let's break it down! In the equation 2x + 5 = 15, 
    you need to isolate x. First, subtract 5 from both 
    sides to get 2x = 10. Then divide by 2.
    What do you get?"

You: "x = 5?"

AI: "Exactly! Well done. Now try the exercise."
```

### Understanding a Reading Passage

```
You: "What is the main idea of this text?"

AI: "The passage talks about how plants grow. 
    The main idea is that plants need sunlight, 
    water, and soil to survive. 
    Look for these key points as you answer!"
```

### Getting Vocabulary Help

```
You: "What does 'photosynthesis' mean?"

AI: "Photosynthesis is how plants make their food 
    using sunlight. 'Photo' means light, and 
    'synthesis' means putting together. 
    Plants put together sunlight, water, and CO2 
    to make energy!"
```

## Tips for Using the Assistant

### Ask Good Questions

| Good Question | Why It Works |
|---------------|--------------|
| "What does this word mean?" | Specific, clear |
| "Can you explain step 2?" | Points to exactly where you're stuck |
| "Why is option B wrong?" | Helps you understand the reasoning |

| Avoid | Why |
|-------|-----|
| "What's the answer?" | AI won't just give answers |
| "Do this for me" | Learning happens when you do it |
| "Is it A or B?" | AI helps you figure it out |

### Best Practices

1. **Try first** - Attempt the exercise before asking
2. **Be specific** - Point to what's confusing
3. **Read carefully** - Read the AI's response fully
4. **Apply the help** - Use hints to find your own answer

## What the AI Won't Do

### Won't Give Direct Answers

The AI is designed to help you learn, not do the work for you:
- ❌ Won't tell you "The answer is B"
- ❌ Won't solve the problem for you
- ❌ Won't complete exercises

### Why This Is Good

- You learn better by figuring it out
- Understanding sticks longer than memorizing
- You build problem-solving skills

---

## Language Support

### Available Languages

The AI can help you in:
- English
- Spanish
- German

### Switching Languages

Ask in any supported language:
- "¿Me puedes ayudar con esto?"
- "Kannst du mir das erklären?"

The AI responds in the language you use.

## Troubleshooting

### AI Doesn't Understand

Try:

### AI Seems Repetitive

Try:

- Being more specific about what you need
- Asking "explain it a different way"

### Can't Access AI
