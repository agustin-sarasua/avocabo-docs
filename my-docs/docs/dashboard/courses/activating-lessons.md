# Activating Lessons

Lessons are created in an **inactive** state by default, giving you complete control over when students can access content. This guide explains how to manage lesson activation effectively.

## Understanding Lesson Activation

### What is an Active Lesson?

| Active | Inactive |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ Visible to students | ❌ Hidden from students |
| ✅ Can be completed | ❌ Cannot be accessed |
| ✅ Counts toward progress | ❌ No student interaction |

### Why Control Activation?

1. **Pace learning** - Release content according to your teaching plan
2. **Review first** - Check content before students see it
3. **Flexible scheduling** - Adapt to class needs
4. **Progressive learning** - Ensure prerequisites are completed first

## Methods of Activation

### 1. Dashboard Widget (Recommended)

The fastest way to activate multiple lessons:

1. Go to **Dashboard**
2. Find the **"Activate Lessons"** widget
3. Select lessons to activate
4. Click **Activate Selected**

**Features:**
- Filter by course
- Multi-select lessons
- See activation status at a glance

### 2. Course Details Page

Activate lessons within a specific course:

1. Navigate to **Courses**
2. Select your course
3. Open a module
4. Toggle the activation switch for each lesson

### 3. Lesson Details Page

Activate individual lessons:

1. Open the lesson details
2. Click the **Activate** button
3. Confirm activation

---

## Activation Strategies

### Progressive Activation

Activate lessons as students complete previous content:

```
Week 1: Activate Lessons 1-3
Week 2: Activate Lessons 4-6 (after Week 1 is complete)
Week 3: Activate Lessons 7-9
...
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents students from skipping ahead
- Ensures prerequisite knowledge
- Maintains pacing consistency

### Module-Based Activation

Activate entire modules at once:

1. Open the module in course details
2. Click **Activate All Lessons in Module**
3. All lessons in that module become active

**Best for:**
- Self-paced courses
- Review modules
- Intensive study periods

### Scheduled Activation

Plan your activations in advance:

| Week | Lessons to Activate | Topics |
|------|---------------------|--------|
| 1 | 1-3 | Introduction, Basics |
| 2 | 4-5 | Intermediate Concepts |
| 3 | 6-8 | Advanced Topics |
| 4 | 9-10 | Review and Practice |

## Deactivating Lessons

### When to Deactivate

- Lesson needs updates or corrections
- Content is seasonally relevant
- Course restructuring

### How to Deactivate

1. Navigate to the lesson
2. Toggle the activation switch **off**
3. Lesson becomes hidden from students

:::warning Note
Students who have already started a deactivated lesson can still complete it. Deactivation only prevents new access.

## Best Practices

### Planning Your Activation Schedule

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| ✅ Plan activation calendar | ❌ Activate randomly |
| ✅ Align with teaching schedule | ❌ Activate everything at once |
| ✅ Consider student pace | ❌ Ignore completion rates |
| ✅ Leave buffer time | ❌ Over-schedule content |

### Managing Different Groups

For classes at different levels:

1. **Same course, different pacing**
   - Activate fewer lessons for slower groups
   - Activate more for advanced groups

2. **Use the AI Assistant**
   - Ask "How is Group A progressing?"
   - Adjust activation based on response

### Communicating with Students

Let students know what's coming:
- Announce upcoming lesson activations
- Set expectations for weekly content
- Provide overview of course timeline

---

## Monitoring Progress

### Checking Activation Status

View which lessons are active:

1. Open course details
2. Look for the **status indicator** on each lesson:
   - 🟢 Green = Active
   - ⚪ Gray = Inactive

### Student Progress Tracking

After activating lessons:

1. Monitor completion rates
2. Check average time per lesson
3. Review exercise performance
4. Identify struggling students

### Using Metrics

Navigate to **Metrics** to see:
- Lessons completed this week
- Student engagement levels
- Performance by lesson

---

## Troubleshooting

### Students Can't See Active Lessons

Check:
1. ✅ Course is activated (not just lessons)
2. ✅ Student is in an assigned group
3. ✅ Student has logged in after activation
4. ✅ Cache is cleared (student side)

### Accidentally Activated Wrong Lessons

1. Navigate to the lesson
2. Toggle activation **off**
3. Communicate with affected students if needed

### Need to Reactivate for Specific Students

Currently, activation is course-wide. Options:
1. Create a separate course for that student's group
2. Keep the lesson active and provide guidance

---

## Automation Ideas

### Weekly Activation Routine

Establish a regular schedule:

**Every Monday morning:**
1. Review last week's progress
2. Check student completion rates
3. Activate next week's lessons
4. Notify students

### Using the AI Assistant

Ask for help with pacing:

```
"How many lessons should I activate this week 
based on how students performed last week?"
```

```
"Which students haven't completed the 
currently active lessons?"
```
