# Creating AI-Powered Courses

PragmaTeach uses artificial intelligence to help you create comprehensive courses from your educational materials. This guide walks you through the entire course creation process.

## Overview

The course creation process follows these steps:

```
1. Basic Information → 2. Duration & Languages → 3. Documents & Program → 4. Review & Generate
```

:::tip Quality Input = Quality Output
The better your initial setup (documents, course program, descriptions), the better the AI-generated content will be!
:::

## Step 1: Basic Information

### Course Type

First, select the type of course you're creating:

| Type | Best For |
|------|----------|
| **Language Course** | Teaching foreign languages (English, Spanish, German) |
| **Academic Course** | Subject-specific courses (Math, Science, History, etc.) |

### Subject

Select or enter a subject:
- For **Language Courses**: English, Spanish, German, etc.
- For **Academic Courses**: Mathematics, Science, History, or enter a custom subject

### Course Title

Choose a clear, descriptive title:

✅ **Good examples:**
- "7th Grade Mathematics: Algebra and Geometry"
- "Intermediate Spanish: Conversation and Grammar"
- "Introduction to Biology: Cells and Organisms"

❌ **Avoid:**
- "Math" (too vague)
- "My Course" (not descriptive)

### Course Description

Include:
- Learning objectives
- Key topics covered
- Target outcomes

**Example:**
> "This course covers fundamental algebra concepts for 7th grade students, including linear equations, basic geometry, and problem-solving strategies. Students will develop mathematical reasoning skills and learn to apply concepts to real-world problems."

### Target Audience

Specify the educational level:
- Elementary School (ages 6-11)
- Middle School (ages 11-14)
- High School (ages 14-18)
- University/Adult

:::info Why This Matters
The AI uses this information to generate age-appropriate content, vocabulary, and exercise difficulty.
:::

### Assign Groups

Select which student groups will have access to this course:
- Search and select from existing groups
- Or make the course public to all students

---

## Step 2: Duration & Structure

### Course Duration

Choose the number of lessons:

| Option | Lessons | Recommended For |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| Mini | ~10 lessons | Short topics, review courses |
| Short | ~20 lessons | Quarter-length courses |
| 3 Months | ~30 lessons | Semester courses |
| 6 Months | ~60 lessons | Full year courses |
| Custom | You define | Specific requirements |

### Language Settings

#### Primary Language
The main language for course content. This is what students will primarily see.

#### Secondary Languages
Enable automatic translation to additional languages:
- Spanish
- English  
- German

#### Translation Percentage
For bilingual or language courses, set what percentage of lessons appear in the secondary language:
- 0% = All content in primary language
- 50% = Half of lessons in each language
- 100% = All content in secondary language

---

## Step 3: Documents & Course Program

### Uploading Reference Documents

Documents provide context for AI content generation. The AI searches these documents when creating lessons.

**Supported formats:**
- PDF files
- DOCX files
- Web URLs

**Best practices:**
1. ✅ Upload only relevant, high-quality documents
2. ✅ Ensure documents are complete and properly formatted
3. ✅ Better to have 2-3 excellent documents than 10 mediocre ones
4. ✅ Wait for documents to show "indexed" status before proceeding

**What to upload:**
- Textbooks
- Study guides
- Official curriculum documents
- Relevant articles

### Course Program (Curriculum)

For official educational standards compliance, upload your curriculum document:

- Official ministry/institution program documents
- Documents with content tables work best
- Include learning objectives and competencies

**The AI extracts:**
- Program overview
- Learning goals
- Content structure
- Competency codes (CE)
- Achievement criteria

:::warning Important
Verify the extracted content is accurate before proceeding. This ensures your course aligns with required standards.
:::

## Step 4: Review the Clustering Plan

Before generating content, the AI analyzes your documents and proposes a content structure.

### What the Clustering Plan Shows

- **Modules** - High-level course sections
- **Lessons per Module** - How content is distributed
- **Content Order** - Progression from foundational to advanced topics

### Review Checklist

- [ ] Module count makes sense for the topic
- [ ] Lessons are evenly distributed across modules
- [ ] Foundational concepts come before advanced topics
- [ ] No unnecessary duplication of content
- [ ] Logical flow for student learning

### Adjusting the Plan

If needed, you can:
- Reorganize content between modules
- Merge or split modules
- Reorder lessons within modules

---

## Step 5: Generate the Course

Once you've reviewed everything:

1. Click **"Generate Course"**
2. Wait for the AI to create content (this may take several minutes)
3. View progress updates as modules and lessons are generated

### What Gets Generated

For each **Module:**
- Title and description
- Topics covered
- Module image

For each **Lesson:**
- Title and description
- Lesson topics
- Lesson image
- Connection to document content

For each **Exercise:** (generated separately)
- Multiple choice questions
- Reading comprehension
- Listening comprehension
- Video exercises
- Math problems
- Interactive activities

---

## After Course Creation

### Review Generated Content

Before activating:
1. ✅ Review module titles and descriptions
2. ✅ Check lesson content for accuracy
3. ✅ Test the course flow
4. ✅ Verify translations if applicable

### Assign Teachers

Add additional teachers to help manage the course:
1. Go to Course Details
2. Click "Manage Teachers"
3. Select teachers to add

### Activate the Course

The course is created in **inactive** state. To make it visible to students:

1. Review all content
2. Click **"Activate Course"**
3. Students in assigned groups can now see it

### Activate Lessons

Control which lessons students can access:

- **Activate individually**: Toggle lessons one by one
- **Activate in batch**: Use the dashboard widget to activate multiple lessons
- **Recommended**: Activate progressively as students complete previous lessons

## Tips for Best Results

### Document Quality
| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Upload complete, official documents | Upload incomplete or draft documents |
| Use well-formatted PDFs | Use scanned images with poor OCR |
| Include comprehensive content | Include only summaries |

### Course Information
| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Provide detailed descriptions | Use one-word titles |
| Specify exact target audience | Be vague about student level |
| Include learning objectives | Skip the description |

### Review Process
| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Review clustering plan carefully | Accept without checking |
| Verify content before activating | Activate immediately after generation |
| Test the student experience | Skip testing |

## Troubleshooting

### Course Generation Takes Too Long
- Large courses (60+ lessons) take 15-30 minutes
- If stuck, try refreshing the page
- Check your internet connection

### Generated Content Seems Incorrect
- Review your uploaded documents for relevance
- Check if course program was extracted correctly
- Consider providing more detailed descriptions

### Documents Not Indexing
- Ensure file format is supported
- Try re-uploading the document
- Contact support if the issue persists
