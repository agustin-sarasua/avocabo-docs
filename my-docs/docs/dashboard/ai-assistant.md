## Types of Questions

### About Students

Ask about individual students or groups:

**Performance questions:**
```
"How is Maria Garcia performing in Math 7?"
```

```
"Which students haven't completed any lessons this week?"
```

```
"Show me the progress of Group 7A"
```

**Recommendations:**
```
"Which students need extra help in Science?"
```

```
"What should I focus on with struggling students?"
```

### About Courses

Get insights about your courses:

**Effectiveness:**
```
"How effective is my Algebra course?"
```

```
"Which lessons have the lowest completion rates?"
```

```
"What topics are students struggling with most?"
```

**Improvements:**
```
"How can I improve the Science course?"
```

```
"Which exercises should I revise?"
```

### About Lessons

Analyze specific lessons:

```
"How are students doing with Lesson 5 of Math 7?"
```

```
"Which exercises in Lesson 3 are too difficult?"
```

```
"What's the average time students spend on Lesson 7?"
```

### Generating Reports

Request reports directly:

```
"Generate a progress report for Group 7A this month"
```

```
"Show me weekly lesson activations"
```

```
"Summarize student performance for parent meetings"
```

## Tips for Effective Questions

### Be Specific

| Good | Why Better | Bad |
|------|------------|-----|
| "How is Juan Pérez doing in Math 7?" | Specific student and course | "How are students doing?" |
| "Which students in 7A haven't completed Lesson 5?" | Specific group and lesson | "Who is behind?" |
| "Compare progress between 7A and 7B in Science" | Clear comparison | "Which class is better?" |

### Provide Context

When asking, include:
- **Course name** if relevant
- **Student/group name** if about someone specific
- **Time period** if comparing over time
- **Lesson or module** if about specific content

## Example Conversations

### Preparing for Parent Meeting

```
You: "Give me a summary of Maria Garcia's performance this semester"

AI: "Maria Garcia has completed 85% of her assigned lessons in Math 7.
    Her average score is 78%, with strongest performance in 
    Geometry (92%) and room for improvement in Algebra (65%).
    She typically completes lessons within the expected time frame.
    Recommendation: Focus on algebraic equations practice."
```

### Weekly Planning

```
You: "Which lessons should I activate next week for 7A?"

AI: "Based on 7A's current progress:
    - 78% have completed Lessons 1-5
    - Average performance: 82%
    - Recommendation: Activate Lessons 6-7
    - Note: 3 students haven't completed Lesson 5 yet"
```

### Identifying Struggling Students

```
You: "Which students in my Science course need help?"

AI: "Students requiring attention in Science 101:
    1. Pedro Martínez - 45% completion, low scores
    2. Ana López - No activity in 2 weeks
    3. Carlos Ruiz - Multiple failed attempts on exercises
    
    Recommendation: Schedule individual check-ins"
```

## What the AI Can Access

The AI has access to:

| Data Type | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| **Student Data** | Progress, scores, activity |
| **Course Data** | Structure, lessons, exercises |
| **Metrics** | Completion rates, time spent |
| **Groups** | Membership, assignments |

### Privacy Considerations

- AI only accesses data you have permission to view
- Teacher sees only their assigned students
- Admin sees school-wide data

---

## Follow-Up Questions

The AI remembers context during the conversation:

```
You: "Show me Pedro's performance in Math"
AI: [Shows Pedro's Math performance]

You: "What about his Science grades?"
AI: [Shows Pedro's Science performance - remembers "Pedro"]

You: "Compare him to the class average"
AI: [Compares Pedro to class - remembers context]
```

---

## Generating Reports

### Quick Reports

Ask for specific reports:

```
"Generate a weekly progress report for 7A"
```

```
"Create a lesson completion summary for Science 101"
```

```
"Show student performance by exercise type"
```

### Report Contents

AI-generated reports include:
- Summary statistics
- Key insights
- Recommendations
- Specific student callouts

### Using for Meetings

**For parent meetings:**
```
"Prepare a parent-friendly summary for Juan Pérez"
```

**For administration:**
```
"Generate a course effectiveness report for this quarter"
```

## Limitations

The AI Assistant:
- ❌ Cannot modify data (read-only access)
- ❌ Cannot activate lessons or courses
- ❌ Cannot create or delete content
- ❌ Doesn't have real-time data (slight delay)

For actions, use the dashboard directly.

## Best Practices

### Regular Check-ins

Use the AI weekly to:
1. Check overall progress
2. Identify struggling students
3. Plan lesson activations
4. Review course effectiveness

### Before Important Meetings

Prepare with:
1. Student-specific summaries
2. Progress comparisons
3. Recommendations for improvement

### For Course Improvement

Regularly ask:
1. Which lessons need work
2. What exercises are too hard/easy
3. How to improve engagement

---

## Troubleshooting

### AI Doesn't Understand

Try:
- Being more specific
- Including names and course titles
- Breaking complex questions into simpler ones

### No Data Available

Check:
- Students have started the course
- Sufficient time has passed for data
- You have access to the requested data

### Incorrect Information

- Verify the student/course names
- Check the time period specified
- Report issues to support if persistent
